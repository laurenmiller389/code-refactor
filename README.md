# code-refactor

## Description

This project is a refactoring of code already provided by Columbia University for a sample website that we must reorganize. None of the original code itself was altered, only refactoring and pseudo-code was implemented to improve the use of semantic HTML elements, sequential order, re-organized element structure, and more.
